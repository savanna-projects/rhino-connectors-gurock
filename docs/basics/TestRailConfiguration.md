> Rhino can be integrated with both Jira Server (on premise) and Jira cloud.

In order so successfully integrate with Jira, TestRail requires some adjustments and setups. Without these setups, some of the features (like bugs manager) might not work properly.

## Priorities Configuration
Rhino uses the case priority as the priority value when creating a bug for that case. In order to make sure the integration is correct, the priorities list must match on both TestRail and Jira sides.  

Assuming that Jira priorities are as follow (names and order):
1. Highest
2. High
3. Medium
4. Low
5. Lowest  

Please follow these steps in order to align TestRail priorities with Jira:  

1. From TestRail main page, click on **Administration** link.

7. Using the arrows arrange the priorities in the same order as they appear in Jira
    1. Highest
    2. High
    3. Medium
    4. Low
    5. Lowest

8. Under Jira, open **Create Issue** screen find **Priority** field, delete the value in it, and click to expand it. It is expected that the values in Jira will be the same with both name and order as in TestRail.
